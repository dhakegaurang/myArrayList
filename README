Data Structures used in terms of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

int[] array for storing input from file:
Array will be fixed size of 50 at the beginning. As and when input size increases, array size is then increased by 50% each time.
Used bubble sort for sorting

Big O Time complexity:O(n^2) at worst case
Big O Space complexity:O(n)

"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.”
